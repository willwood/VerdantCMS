# VerdantCMS
This is the repository for VerdantCMS. A simple, fast, friendly and lightweight website CMS (content management system). As work progresses, code and more content will get published here.

Essentially I want to roll my own efficient CMS that can be used for smaller websites. It would draw some inspiration from a couple of past CMS platforms I've enjoyed using, but refrain from being an exact copy of them.

Many feature-rich CMS solutions already exist that let you construct entire websites; with functionality like advanced permissions and author roles, version tracking, drag-and-drop page builders and sophisticated file managers. But there aren't so many solutions at the other end of the spectrum. I'm mostly only interested in something that lets a client login, make changes to page content, save those changes, and logout again. In other words, a bolt-on CMS for existing websites, where only limited parts need to be editable.

**Things I'm aiming for with VerdantCMS:**
- Emphasis on maintainability, speed and ease of use.
- EN 301 549 compliance, ensuring it can be used by anyone across a broad range of devices and web browsers.
- Community led, free and opensource. Opting for the well-known and common MIT license. Whitelabel, no branding.
- Cross-platform and portable. Meaning it can be used with different design apps and moved between web servers with ease.
- GDPR compliant, with no dependencies on any outside services. No analytics, finger print trackers or backdoors.
- Possibly favouring Markdown over ugly and somewhat outdated rich text editors.
- Several layers of security and validation. Following industry best practices.
- Multilingual support.
- Store data in a SQLite database. For all the great benefits SQLite gives us.
